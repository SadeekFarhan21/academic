In my role as a Teaching Assistant for CSE 2231, I assisted the instructor in delivering lectures and lab sessions focused on software development principles and design methodologies. I facilitated coding workshops, graded assignments, and provided one-on-one support to students. My contributions helped students understand key concepts such as Agile development, system design, and testing practices, fostering a collaborative and engaging learning environment.
