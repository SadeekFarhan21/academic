## About Me

Hello, and welcome to my homepage! I am an undergraduate student at MIT, studying computer science and electrical engineering. My research interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. I have worked on projects involving neural networks and image processing, and I am currently exploring applications of AI in autonomous systems.

In high school, I participated in various programming competitions and hackathons, where I developed a passion for coding and problem-solving. I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects and pushing the boundaries of technology.
